# LearningManagementSystem

Optimizing students’ learning processes by considering individual differences in education creates difficulties in current systems. Traditional methods cannot adequately adapt to each student’s learning style, pace and needs, and this limits individual success. This project aims to use artificial intelligence algorithms to analyze students’ learning processes and provide personalized educational content.

Enhanced features:

Special homepage and user homepage for teachers and students.
Students can access texts that provide explanations about the course they are enrolled in.
Students can create their own exams by selecting the topic and difficulty level.
Students can view statistics of their exam results down to the most detailed points.
The topic-based level is determined according to the exam results and additional resources are provided to the student by the system.
Students can make Q&A via chat.

Undeveloped features:

Teacher interface and file lesson adding interface
Special interface for teacher to monitor specific students.
Class selection interface for student and teacher.
Various hypothetical process graphs for student created with artificial intelligence based on other students' data. For example, score increase in the next month according to the number of exams.
Student learning style detection system.
Additional resource suggestion system for student.
Exams with special duration, date and questions other than custom exams.
