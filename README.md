# LearningManagementSystem

Optimizing students’ learning processes by considering individual differences in education creates difficulties in current systems. Traditional methods cannot adequately adapt to each student’s learning style, pace and needs, and this limits individual success. This project aims to use artificial intelligence algorithms to analyze students’ learning processes and provide personalized educational content.
